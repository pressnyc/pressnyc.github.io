        <h2>About This Site</h2>
        <p><strong>Why is this dashboard needed?</strong> A People's Dashboard would not be necessary if the de Blasio administration, Department of Health, and Department of Education were more transparent in their reporting of Covid cases in our schools. We hope these resources will allow parents, the press, elected officials, students and staff a better understanding of what is happening in their own schools, in the system as a whole, and over time. The more we know, the better we can advocate for safety for all students, especially Black, Latinx, immigrant students, students with disabilities and students in temporary housing.</p>
        <p><strong>Who created the People's Dashboard?</strong> This is a project of <a href="https://www.pressnyc.org">PRESS NYC</a>. It was designed and developed by <a href="https://backspace.com/">John Emerson</a> and <a href="https://current.workingdirectory.net">Jamie McClelland</a> in collaboration with Professor Jen Jennings and members of PRESS NYC’s steering committee.</p>
        <p><strong>What's PRESS NYC?</strong> Parents for Responsive Equitable Safe Schools (<a href="https://www.pressnyc.org">PRESS NYC</a>) is a parent collective spanning generations, cultures, fields of expertise, & zip codes, building community across school districts to hold the DOE, the Mayor, & the education press accountable. Follow us @safeschoolsny on all socials.</p>
